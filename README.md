# GPT Implementation

This project implements a **GPT** from scratch in PyTorch, inspired by Andrej Karpathyâ€™s tutorials.  
It trains a character-level language model on a given text corpus (Beatles lyrics in this case) and can generate new text samples.

## Features
- Character-level tokenization.
- Implements **multi-head self-attention** and **transformer blocks** manually.
- Training loop with train/validation split and periodic loss evaluation.
- Text generation using autoregressive sampling.
